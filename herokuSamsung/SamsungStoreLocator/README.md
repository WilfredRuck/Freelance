# Snap It Up

Snap It Up was a promotional program for Samsung. We partnered with Verizon and Snapchat to get users to snap a QR code on participating Verizon store windows. This website allowed the users to find those select stores. Once the QR code is scanned, the user is sent to a mobile-only website that shows a discount code for the corresponding offer. The store locator contained a database of 537 stores, while the discount code website contained a database of 10,000+ codes. This was a 7 day only promotion and gained ~950 users per day.
